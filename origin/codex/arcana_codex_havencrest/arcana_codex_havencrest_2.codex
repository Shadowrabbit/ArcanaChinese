    "As an essential part of the Arcanian history, the Arcanians respect the oasis springs more than anything else, as it is the foundation of their land's fertility. Many would gather each day, to pray to Nillus, the god of springs.",
	"Aside from supporting the everyday life of the Arcanians, the springs have also been found to have a degree of healing properties. Simply resting in the waters would put one's mind at ease, as well.",
	"While the springs are public, it is considered a high offence to litter or put waste in the waters."
