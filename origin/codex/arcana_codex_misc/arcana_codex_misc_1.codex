    "Throughout the ages, certain elemental fusions have been recorded. Such fusions are what created the abomination of Evolapis, and the mysterious Seeker of Dust. On rare occasions, an entirely new form is created such as the Radiant Steel.",
	"Artificial items created using these fusions are generally referred as the Magna. While It's hard to obtain such fusions through normal means, the icy borealites seem to be capable of catalyzing these fusion reactions."
