    "Residing primarily in the Badlands, the Steelblades appear to be just another group of mercenaries. Perhaps a bit more chivalrous than most, they also seem to follow a strict set of moral codes. While they're small in size, their weaponry are highly capable and surpasses the average mercenaries.",
	"Still, they cannot compete with the higher leagues with firepower alone. What classified them as a Titan-Class threat is their leader, the Gray Knight. There isn't much information on their activities, but they're believed to be associated with the Ironsides, and possibly even the once purged Gray Radiance. High alert is advised if you ever encounter this individual."
